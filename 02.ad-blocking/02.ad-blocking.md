# Advertisements Everywhere

In the current age, quite a large portion of digital industry survives on Advertisements. Especially commercial social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so on. But advertisements are not only limited to those companies. Any company, which desires to survive and thrive, usually follows a model involving Advertisements towards their target users. It is not their fault or anything. A company which is giving basically _free_ services still has to earn money somehow to manage their, often massive, servers and employee costs. To be honest, I think advertisements are fine and don't represent any threat themselves. The problem arises with the current state of advertisements, which clearly is outright ridiculous.

These days, advertisements are far too invading, intruding, and frankly, annoying. Many websites have advertisements literally everywhere the user looks on the web page and often, unsuspecting users accidently navigate through the advertisements which they fall for and end up completely confused.

The advertisements also contain malware which target one's computer/mobile and install potentially hazardous applications and software, hindering the users' experience.
Even the websites themeselves use various tracking agencies to track what their users are doing. This data is then sold to the advertisement agencies (they use this data to show the users' advertisements which they might be interested in) and that, is how the companies earn money.

The trackers which track users, and the malwares which reside in virtually every websites these days, are outrageous at best and they are used relentlessly to exploit the users.

# Why Does It Affect People?

One may wonder:

> How does it affect me? Tracking is fine and does not matter, and I am careful about the false links and advertisements!

Well, yes. You might be really careful about false links, and advertisements, but that does not mean that it is okay to do that! There are many people who are not as _careful_ as you might be. If something is wrong, but doesn't affect you, it does not mean that it can simply be forgotten about.

And tracking, that's **NOT** good! Imagine, someone knows exactly what you are doing on the Internet, what your moves are, who are you talking to, what are you talking about, and, with enough analysis, how do you think! It is like someone is looking upon you at all times, and not to protect you, but to keep you under surveillance in order to exploit you to benefit them, especially when you are at your weakest state!

We keep saying to our parents to give us privacy, yet, here is an entire company, or a group of companies, who are tracking everything you do. And since most peoples' lives are highly tied to Internet, they have to understand the seriousness of this issue.

These threats just arised from companies. Now imagine that a notorious individual gets hold of your precious data (which is tracked off you by the way!). They can use your data however they like, and, with enough information, they might as well threaten you in the worst of ways, leaving you absolutely devastated!

Hence, one must be really wary about what data goes on the servers and what is being tracked off of you.

# What Can We Do About It?

Thankfully, there are several ways with which we can protect ourselves from these malicious trackers and advertisements. Honestly, these are not completely reliable and will not save you 100%, but with enough work, one can safe themselves completely.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to modify a system file (on computer), and install an application (on mobile) to block the pesky advertisements and trackers.

> **Note**: One can also perform a similar process on a Jailbroken iOS device, but it is complex and is not within the scope of this guide.

Also, note that we can do a lot more than just blocking advertisements. We will explore those options in the future.

Well, what are we waiting for?! Let's get started with blocking the advertisements and trackers!

# Blocking The Advertisements On Computer (Linux/Mac)

## Prerequisites

* A computer/laptop running Linux or Mac (doh!)
* Superuser access (sudo or root user)
* Working Internet (you probably have that since you are reading this)

## Procedure

Okay, let's do it!

* First, head over to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts). It contains the list (quite expansive) of hosts/websites which we are going to block.
* Scroll down a bit, and you will find **List of hosts file variants**. Decide which _Host File Recipe_ is the most suitable for you. If in doubt, just go for the last entry - **Unified hosts + fakenews + gambling + porn + social**. This one will block all the websites known for tracking/advertisements, along with fakenews, gambling, porn and social websites (since social websites contribute heavily to tracking and advertisements). However, you might want to retain social media, in which case, go with **Unified hosts + fakenews + gambling + porn** option.
* Click on the respective **Raw host link** of your selected recipe, and wait for the file to load up in your browser. It might take some time due to the size of the file (3-4 MB approximately).
* Once the file opens, you will be greeted with a massive lists of items (hosts). Copy everything (Ctrl/Cmd + a & Ctrl/Cmd + c).
* open up your hosts file. This file provides information to the system about which IP to go to, for a particular hostname. To open this file, go to your terminal, open up your favorite editor with root privileges (root user or using sudo), while passing the full file location as argument. The full path location for hosts file is: `/etc/hosts`. For example, my favorite editor is `vim`, so I go open up my terminal and type `sudo vim /etc/hosts`.
* Once the file has been opened, go to the bottom and paste the data previously copied. The copying will take a while due to the sheer number of items being copied.
* Once the copy is finished, save the file and quit the editor.
* **That's it**! That's all you needed to do to block advertisements from your computer!

There are more options like extensions in browser, but those extensions are not system wide and will only protect your browser. Having them is definitely a good idea though.

# Blocking The Advertisements on Mobile (Android)

## Prerequisites

* A rooted android device (See my previous blog post: [Rooting the (OnePlus 6) Android Device](https://blog.electrux.me/posts/01.rooting-op6) for a guide on how to root the OnePlus 6 device)
* Internet connectivity on the mobile
* F-Droid apk file: [Here](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk)

## Procedure

### Installing F-Droid

* Android has **Play Store** as the marketplace for applications. However, unbeknownest to many people, it is not the only marketplace. There is also **F-Droid**. F-Droid contains all applications that are free and open-source. The applications we need is available there. Hence, we first get F-Droid from the link in the prerequisites.
* Open the FDroid.apk file from the file browser on your device. It will probably complain about Security issue when the application is installed from sources other than play store, and will give option to go to **Settings** to change that behavior.
* Go to the settings as it says, and click on **Allow applications to be installed from unknown sources**.
* Now when you open the FDroid.apk file, you will be asked if you want to install the application. Click **install**.
* Congratulations! You now have F-Droid installed.

### Installing AdAway

* As we have installed the FDroid application, we can now install the adblocker which will modify the **hosts** file for us instead of us having to do so manually (like in computer).
* Open the FDroid application, and search for **Adaway**. The image of application should be as follows:

<center>
![AdAway Image](https://f-droid.org/repo/icons-640/org.adaway.61.png)
</center>

* Install the application and open it. The first time you open it, it will ask for **Superuser** permission (you **MUST** be rooted). Grant it the permission and click on **Download files and apply ad blocking**.
* It will download some files and install them, and ask you to reboot the system, so reboot it.
* **Congratulations**! You have successfully installed AdAway and have blocked quite a large chunk of advertisements and trackers from your ENTIRE device!

> **Note**: It does not block advertisements on YouTube. For that, you probably will have to get a replacement application for YouTube.

Anyway, that is all for this post everyone! Thanks for reading. I believe it was informative and hopefully enjoyable!

Until next time!
