# Some Background

Every single human being has the authority to do what they want without any restrictions - so long as it does not cause harm to others. The rules and regulations made by us humans towards behavior is, however, quite necessary to prevent utter chaos breaking lose.

Therefore, to maintain the balance between regulations and freedom, in comes **Privacy** & **Security**.

# Privacy

Every person has secrets. For better, or for worse, each and everyone, has some secret or the other. One thing that must be kept in mind is that secrey does not inherently have a negative connotation, nor does it imply dark intent.

For example, parents keep secrets from their children - most prominent being - how hard it is for them to raise the children mentally, physically, and financially. Yet, they do not let their children's smiles wear off.

Okay, anyway, too much sentiments :P! The point being, secrecy, just like any other thing, may be good or bad. However, every person has the right to it. And that, dear readers, is why privacy is so important.

# Security

I don't think anyone really needs a formal definition of security. It is virtually found everywhere! We have even have security for our homes!

Security means, that malicious users must not be able to access the private data of anyone. There are many people with the intent of stealing others' data or performing some deeds that would harm others.

People need protection from that, and that itself is the purpose of security. In computing devices, we have security in the form of passwords, Multiple Factor Authentications, and even Biometrics.

# Current State of Privacy

In a nutshell, the privacy is all but nonexistent, with people not being aware enough about it, and most companies and governments basically laughing on it. Take a look at Facebook, Google, or any other **big company** (most of them), they relentlessly break the last shard of privacy of anyone who uses their services. And it's not like they are breaking laws. They clearly mention in their privacy policy and terms & conditions that they are basically going to burn people's privacy to hell by tracking the life out of them. It's just that this privacy information is cleverly hidden away in their ludicrously long documents which we always ignore very diligently.

These companies collect all the data they can from the users - us - and generate a profile of us. You would be surprized to find how eerily accurate these profiles can be. They, then, sell this information about the users to other companies who pay a lot of money for this information. Most of these companies give targeted advertisements based on the information gathered about the person, and hence, the person in question sees a lot of advertisements throughout the Internet which have a mighty better change at appealing to her/him.

They also, especially companies based in the US, hand over this collected data to government authorities if asked for without the consent of the people of whom the data is being provided. In other words, they freely browse through your data and can analyze your eating habits, sleeping patterns, what you search on Internet, without all too much effort. Even if the company might not want to out the data, they actually have to due to the constitution clearly stating it.

There are, however, quite some companies and individuals who fight for the privacy of the people and continuously spread the awareness about it. These are our true heroes and saviors and we must kneel before them!

When most people are asked about privacy and what they are doing about it, the most common reply is:

> Eh, it's ok! I have got nothing to hide!

Well, that is actually the first thought of anyone. It's just, when one realizes what can actually be done with the data being collected, they get a jolt of what is really going on and why is it so bad. Imagine, you're talking with someone about something personal, only to realize that the _veil_ of privacy, of secrecy, is nothing but a big, fat, virtuality. That you are being constantly monitored about what you do and are basically kept under mass surveillance at all times.

It is true that one might not have any problems with that, and it might not even effect them. But that doesn't mean it is not a direct breach of one's privacy - which every human being has a fundamental right to. And that, is the sad thing.

# What Can be Done?

Well, I have been rambling on and on about what privacy & security are, and what is the current state of privacy. But the important question is, as end users, what can the people do about it?

Okay, first of all, congratulations! You are probably doing something about it because you have patiently read this article till this point! Kudos to that.

There are quite some things that can be done about it. Do understand that they are usually not quite as easy and convenient, but then again, nothing worthwhile ever is! You will have to understand that it will take a while to grasp and apply the information in order to safeguard your privacy (and security). But it is definitely possible to quite a great extent and, possibly, quite some fun too!

So folks! Here it is. A basic rundown of Privacy & Security. I shall be going in-depth in later posts and hopefully it will benefit you all. If you have anything to say, go ahead and create an issue on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Electrux/blog).

Watch out for the upcoming posts, and have a great day!
